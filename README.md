# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. This project aims to provide a framework for sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques.
